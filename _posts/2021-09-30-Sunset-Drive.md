I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you and
For a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true, down
And all this time I have been lyin'
Oh, lyin' in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the
Farthest place on my shelf

And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
