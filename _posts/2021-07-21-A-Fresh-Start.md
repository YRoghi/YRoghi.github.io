It's been a hot minute since I've created an entry on here. If anything, I've purged the
prior entries due to them being somewhat outdated and out of context.

After finishing up an intense 6 months of my life, I'm finally coming back to working on
a few pet projects and learning points I've been meaning to get to. This platform will
serve as my way to log my progress through all of this (and maybe share some photos of
some IRL stuff I do...?).

Stay tuned for more!
